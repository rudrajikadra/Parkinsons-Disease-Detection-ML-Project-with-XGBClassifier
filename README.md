# Parkinsons-Disease-Detection-With-XGBoost

In this project, I have created a Machine Learning model using XGBClassifier to Detect Parkinsons Disease with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).

Dataset - UCI ML Parkinsons Dataset - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/parkinsons/
